CMake Error: The current CMakeCache.txt directory /home/rmz16/esp/projects/can_recieve_final/build/CMakeCache.txt is different than the directory /home/rafael/esp/projects/can_recieve_final/build where CMakeCache.txt was created. This may result in binaries being created in the wrong place. If you are not sure, reedit the CMakeCache.txt
CMake Error: The source "/home/rmz16/esp/projects/can_recieve_final/CMakeLists.txt" does not match the source "/home/rafael/esp/projects/can_recieve_final/CMakeLists.txt" used to generate cache.  Re-run cmake with a different source directory.
